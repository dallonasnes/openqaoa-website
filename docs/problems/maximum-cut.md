# Maximum Cut

A maximum cut of a graph is a partition of its vertices into two sets, $S$ and $T$, such that the number of edges between them is maximized. The task of finding such a cut is known as the MaxCut Problem.


## The Cost Function

Given a graph $G=(V, E)$, the cost function to minimize for the MaxCut problem is given by

$$
C(\textbf{x}) = -\sum_{(i, j)\in E} w_{ij} (x_i+x_j - 2x_i x_j )
$$

where $w_{ij}$ is the weight corresponding to the edge $(i,j) \in E$, and $\textbf{x}\in \{0, 1\}^{|V|}$ is the binary variable indicating whether node $i$ is in set $S$ or $T$. This works because each term $x_i+x_j - 2x_i x_j$ is equal to 1 if an edge is in the cut, and 0 otherwise.

Note that the equivalent formulation in terms of Ising variables is the following

$$
C(\sigma) = -\sum_{(i, j)\in E} w_{ij} \sigma_i\sigma_j,
$$

where this time $\sigma \in \{-1, 1\}^{|V|}$.

## MaxCut in OpenQAOA

MaxCut being a graph problem, you can leverage the popular `networkx` to easily create a variety of graphs. For example, an Erdös-Rényi graph can be instantiated with

```Python
import networkx as nx

G = nx.generators.fast_gnp_random_graph(n=6, p=0.6, seed=42)
```

OpenQAOA has a nice wrapper to plot networkx graphs

```Python
from openqaoa.utilities import plot_graph
plot_graph(G)
```

Once the graph is defined, creating a MaxCut problem class requires only a few lines of code:

```Python
from openqaoa.problems import MaximumCut

maxcut_prob = MaximumCut(G)
maxcut_qubo = maxcut_prob.qubo
```

We can then access the underlying cost hamiltonian 

```Python
maxcut_qubo.hamiltonian.expression
```

$$
1.0Z_{0}Z_{2} + 1.0Z_{0}Z_{3} + 1.0Z_{0}Z_{4} + 1.0Z_{1}Z_{2} + 1.0Z_{1}Z_{3} + 1.0Z_{1}Z_{5} + 1.0Z_{2}Z_{4} + 1.0Z_{2}Z_{5} + 1.0Z_{3}Z_{5} + 1.0Z_{4}Z_{5}
$$

You may also check all details of the problem instance in the form of a dictionary:

```Python
> maxcut_qubo.asdict()
